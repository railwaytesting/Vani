# VANI

VANI is a cross-platform accessibility platform for Indian Sign Language (ISL).

It combines:
- a Flutter client app (Web, Android, iOS, Desktop targets)
- a FastAPI + YOLO inference backend over WebSocket

The system is designed for real-time sign-to-text assistance, two-way communication, emergency workflows, and multilingual UI support.

## Overview

VANI focuses on practical communication support for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing users in India.

Key runtime flow:
1. Flutter client captures camera frames.
2. Client sends frames (base64) through WebSocket to backend `/ws`.
3. Backend runs YOLO inference on each frame.
4. Backend returns prediction payloads with label + confidence.
5. Client displays real-time results and builds usable sentence output.

## Core Features

- Real-time ISL sign recognition and sentence support
- Two-way communication screen for Deaf/hearing interaction
- Emergency SOS workflow with:
  - local emergency contacts (Hive)
  - optional location embedding
  - mobile shake trigger
  - SMS launch via `url_launcher`
- ISL signs reference screen
- Detailed objective pages (Accessibility, Bridging, Inclusivity, Privacy, Offline, Education)
- Language switching (English, Hindi, Marathi)
- Light/dark theming

## Architecture

### Client (Flutter)

- Main app entry: `lib/main.dart`
- Primary screens:
  - `lib/screens/TranslateScreen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/TwoWayScreen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/EmergencyScreen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/EmergencySetupScreen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/Signspage.dart`
  - `lib/screens/HomeScreen.dart`
- Localization source: `lib/l10n/AppLocalizations.dart`
- Emergency services:
  - `lib/services/EmergencyService.dart`
  - `lib/services/LocationService.dart`

### Backend (FastAPI + YOLO)

- Backend entry: `isl_backend/app.py`
- Health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Inference socket: `WS /ws`
- Model path: `isl_backend/model/isl_best.pt`

### Production Transport

- Client uses secure WebSocket (`wss://`) to Railway host.
- Current host is hardcoded in:
  - `lib/screens/TranslateScreen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/TwoWayScreen.dart`

## Tech Stack

### Flutter Client

- Flutter SDK (Dart 3.11)
- `camera`
- `web_socket_channel`
- `http`
- `flutter_tts`
- `hive` + `hive_flutter`
- `geolocator`
- `url_launcher`
- `shake`
- `vibration`
- `speech_to_text`

### Backend

- Python 3.10
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Ultralytics YOLO
- PyTorch CPU
- OpenCV (headless)
- gdown

## Prerequisites

Install before setup:

- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Git LFS (recommended for large model file workflows)

Quick checks:

```powershell
flutter --version
python --version
git --version
git lfs version
```

## Local Development Setup

## 1) Clone Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/VisheshKamble/ISL.git
cd ISL
```

## 2) Model Artifact (Choose One)

Option A: Pull model via Git LFS (recommended)

```powershell
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Option B: Let backend auto-download model from Google Drive

- If `isl_backend/model/isl_best.pt` is missing, backend downloads it at startup.

## 3) Start Backend

```powershell
cd isl_backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Backend defaults:
- host: `0.0.0.0`
- port: `8000` (or `PORT` env variable if present)

## 4) Start Flutter Client

Open a second terminal at repo root:

```powershell
cd ..
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

Examples:

```powershell
flutter run -d emulator-5554
flutter run -d windows
```

## Runtime Configuration

WebSocket settings are read from `--dart-define` values or the `.env.*` files:

- `ISL_WS_ENABLED`
- `ISL_WS_URL`
- `ISL_WS_SCHEME`
- `ISL_WS_HOST`
- `VANI_CORS_ORIGINS` for backend CORS allow-list, comma-separated
- `VANI_CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX` as a fallback allow pattern for local dev and Railway web deploys

## Validation

- Flutter analyzer and tests are covered by CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- WebSocket URL routing is centralized in `lib/services/backend_config.dart`
- Backend CORS is no longer wide open by default; production origins should be supplied through environment variables
- `ISL_WS_PATH`

Recommended files:
- `.env.local` -> `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`
- `.env.prod` -> `wss://isl-production-57d4.up.railway.app/ws`

Example run commands:

```powershell
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.local
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.prod
```

## API Contract

## `GET /health`

Response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "engine": "YOLOv11-CPU"
}
```

## `WS /ws`

Input messages:
- base64 image frame string (optionally with `data:image/...;base64,` prefix)
- control messages:
  - `__PING__`
  - `__STOP__`

Output messages:

Prediction:

```json
{
  "type": "prediction",
  "label": "hello",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "frame": 118
}
```

Protocol keepalive:

```json
{"type": "ping"}
{"type": "pong"}
```

Error example:

```json
{"type": "error", "message": "Model not available on server"}
```

## Deployment Guide

## Backend Deployment (Railway)

Backend already includes:
- `isl_backend/Dockerfile`
- `isl_backend/railway.json`

Docker startup command:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

Recommended Railway settings:
- Root directory: `isl_backend`
- Builder: Dockerfile
- Health check path: `/health`
- Restart on failure: enabled

Post-deploy checks:
1. Open `https://<your-domain>/health`
2. Confirm `model_loaded` is true
3. Validate WebSocket from app (`wss://<your-domain>/ws`)

## Frontend Deployment (Flutter Web)

Build web bundle:

```powershell
flutter build web --release
```

Output:
- `build/web/`

Deploy `build/web/` to your static hosting target (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, Cloudflare Pages, S3+CDN, etc.).

Important:
- Keep backend on HTTPS and WebSocket on WSS for browser compatibility.

## Model Management

Primary model file:
- `isl_backend/model/isl_best.pt`

Current size in repository:
- 121,378,638 bytes (about 121 MB)

Notes:
- For GitHub, large model files should be tracked with Git LFS.
- Backend includes fallback auto-download via `gdown` when model is missing.

## Localization

Localization class:
- `lib/l10n/AppLocalizations.dart`

Supported locales:
- `en`
- `hi`
- `mr`

Behavior:
- `t(key)` first checks active locale.
- Falls back to English.
- Asserts in debug if key is missing in all locales.

## Emergency Module Details

Storage:
- Hive box: `emergency_contacts`
- Max contacts: 5

Platform behavior:
- Shake trigger: mobile only
- SMS send path: mobile only
- GPS: mobile + web

Main emergency files:
- `lib/services/EmergencyService.dart`
- `lib/services/LocationService.dart`
- `lib/models/EmergencyContact.dart`

## Build and Release Commands

## Flutter

```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Release builds:

```powershell
flutter build web --release
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build windows --release
```

## Backend

```powershell
cd isl_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Container build (optional local test):

```powershell
cd isl_backend
docker build -t vani-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 vani-backend
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1) WebSocket connection fails

- Verify backend is running and reachable.
- Confirm client host in `_kRailwayHost` is correct in both screen files.
- Ensure endpoint is WSS in production.
- Check browser console/network for blocked mixed-content errors.

### 2) Backend starts but model is unavailable

- Confirm `isl_backend/model/isl_best.pt` exists.
- If missing, allow startup download via `gdown`.
- Verify outbound internet access on deployment runtime.

### 3) Slow inference or dropped frames

- Backend currently runs CPU inference.
- Scale instance size or optimize model variant for production load.
- Tune frame interval in client (`_kFrameIntervalMs`).

### 4) SOS does not send messages

- On desktop/web, direct SMS sending is not supported.
- On mobile, ensure contacts are configured and permissions granted.

### 5) Localization crashes in debug

- Missing keys trigger assertion in debug builds.
- Add missing key to active locale and English fallback map.

## Current Status

- Deployment architecture in place (Railway backend + Flutter web/mobile clients).
- WebSocket production host wired in both live translation screens.
- Large model artifact integrated and tracked in repository workflow.
- Objective pages updated to use valid localization keys.

---

If you want, the next upgrade can be centralizing backend host config into one shared environment/config file so you update it once for all screens.
