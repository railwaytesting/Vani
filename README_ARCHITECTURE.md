## 1. System At A Glance

VANI is a cross-platform accessibility system for Indian Sign Language (ISL) support.

High-level architecture:
- Frontend: Flutter app (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop targets)
- Backend: FastAPI service with YOLO inference over WebSocket
- Data transport: base64 camera frames from app to backend, prediction JSON from backend to app
- Auxiliary backend: Supabase for auth + emergency contact synchronization
- Local persistence: Hive for emergency contacts and offline continuity

## 2.4 Frontend Runtime Flow (Prediction Path)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant T as Translate/TwoWay Screen
  participant C as CameraController
  participant W as WebSocket Client
  participant B as Backend WS

  U->>T: Start session
  T->>C: Initialize camera
  T->>W: Connect wss://host/ws
  loop Every frame interval
    C->>T: Capture frame bytes
    T->>W: Send base64 frame
    W->>B: Send frame payload
    B-->>W: prediction JSON
    W-->>T: label + confidence + frame index
    T-->>U: Update overlay, tokens, sentence
  end
  U->>T: Stop session
  T->>W: Send stop / close
  T->>C: Dispose camera
```

## 3. Backend Architecture (FastAPI + YOLO)

Backend root:
- [isl_backend/app.py](isl_backend/app.py)

Deployment files:
- [isl_backend/Dockerfile](isl_backend/Dockerfile)
- [isl_backend/requirements.txt](isl_backend/requirements.txt)
- [isl_backend/railway.json](isl_backend/railway.json)

## 3.1 Startup Pipeline

On startup, backend:
1. prepares model directory
2. validates local model artifact
3. downloads model from Google Drive when absent/corrupt
4. loads YOLO model into CPU runtime
5. exposes health and websocket endpoints

### Startup Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  S[Process Start] --> M{Model file exists and valid?}
  M -- No --> D[Download model via gdown]
  M -- Yes --> L[Load model]
  D --> L
  L --> F[Fuse model ops]
  F --> R[Ready to accept traffic]
```

## 3.2 WebSocket Inference Architecture

The `/ws` endpoint handles:
- socket accept and client lifecycle
- protocol control messages (`__PING__`, `__STOP__`)
- frame decode from base64 to OpenCV image
- inference dispatch in executor to keep event loop responsive
- top detection extraction + confidence
- temporal smoothing of predictions
- JSON prediction response

### Backend Request Processing Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Receive payload] --> B{Is command?}
  B -- PING --> P[Send pong]
  B -- STOP --> Q[Reset smoother]
  B -- FRAME --> C[Throttle check]
  C --> D[Base64 decode]
  D --> E[Image decode]
  E --> F[YOLO inference]
  F --> G[Select top detection]
  G --> H[Smoothing window]
  H --> I[Send prediction JSON]
```

## 3.3 Backend Endpoints

### GET /health

Purpose:
- liveliness and model-load status checks

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "engine": "YOLOv11-CPU"
}
```

### WS /ws

Input payloads:
- base64 frame strings (with or without data URI header)
- control commands: `__PING__`, `__STOP__`

Output payloads:

```json
{
  "type": "prediction",
  "label": "<sign>",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "frame": 123
}
```

Error payload pattern includes:
- type: error
- message: reason text

## 4.2 Pipeline Stage Breakdown

### Stage 1: Capture

- camera is initialized using Flutter camera plugin
- frames are sampled periodically (not full continuous stream)
- capture rate is bounded by timer interval on client

### Stage 2: Serialization And Transport

- image bytes are converted to base64 text
- transport uses WebSocket for low-latency bidirectional communication
- secure transport in production via wss

### Stage 3: Decode And Validate

- server strips optional data URI prefix
- base64 decoded to bytes
- bytes converted to OpenCV matrix (`cv2.imdecode`)

### Stage 4: Inference

- YOLO model performs object/sign detection on CPU
- confidence threshold and max detection count enforce output quality constraints
- inference run in executor to avoid blocking async event loop

### Stage 5: Temporal Smoothing

- rolling window stores recent labels/confidence pairs
- dominant label in window selected
- confidence averaged for selected dominant class
- this reduces visible flicker and accidental transient predictions

### Stage 6: Client Post-Processing

- prediction fed into UI state machine
- confidence/stability used for builder UX and overlays
- user can manually commit/remove tokens
- translated/regional representation and TTS are applied as needed

## 4.3 Latency And Throughput Considerations

Key controls visible in code:
- frontend frame interval constant controls send frequency
- backend frame skip constant controls infer cadence
- max detection = 1 simplifies result handling and improves speed
- smoothing window improves UX confidence at slight temporal lag

Trade-offs:
- lower interval -> faster updates but more CPU/network load
- higher threshold -> fewer false positives but more misses
- larger smoothing window -> steadier labels but slower adaptation

## 6. Data And State Architecture

## 6.1 Local State

Storage engine:
- Hive box `emergency_contacts`

Entity:
- EmergencyContact fields include identity, relation, primary marker, and optional Supabase row id

Benefits:
- offline-first emergency workflow
- fast local reads
- explicit sync boundaries with cloud

## 6.2 Remote State (Supabase)

Used for:
- authentication/session
- user profile updates
- emergency contacts persistence and sync

Sync model:
- after login/signup, app can pull contacts from Supabase to local Hive
- local contacts without remote IDs can be pushed to Supabase

## 6.3 Real-Time Stream State

Managed in translation screens:
- socket connectivity state
- camera readiness and lifecycle state
- session state machine (idle/connecting/running/stopping/error)
- current label, confidence, and builder token collections

## 7. Architecture For Internationalization

Localization strategy:
- all user-facing strings accessed through key lookups
- supported locales include English, Hindi, Marathi
- fallback to English if locale value is missing
- localization delegate configured globally in MaterialApp

Impact on architecture:
- feature modules are language-agnostic at logic level
- text surfaces remain centrally maintainable via localization map

## 8. Deployment Architecture

## 8.1 Backend Deployment (Railway)

Deployment model:
- Dockerfile-based build
- single replica by default in railway config
- restart-on-failure policy

Runtime details:
- process binds to env-driven `PORT`
- health endpoint can be used by platform checks

## 8.2 Frontend Deployment

- mobile via Flutter Android/iOS build pipeline
- web via Flutter web build and static hosting
- runtime ML endpoint currently configured in app constants for Translate and TwoWay screens

## 8.3 Environment/Config Notes

Current project pattern includes constants for:
- websocket host/path in translation screens
- optional backend-enable flags in service/screen modules
- Supabase values supplied via dart-define for app bootstrap

## 9. Reliability, Failure Modes, And Recovery

## 9.1 Client-Side Failure Cases

- camera unavailable or permission denied
- websocket unreachable
- transient disconnect during session
- translation/TTS API failures
- location acquisition timeout

Recovery patterns in code:
- session transitions to explicit error state
- reconnect attempts with max retry limits
- graceful fallback messages and controllable restart path

## 9.2 Backend Failure Cases

- model download failure
- model load incompatibility
- malformed frame payloads
- inference exceptions per-frame

Recovery patterns:
- startup logs and model availability checks
- health endpoint reflects model_loaded
- frame processing errors are isolated and loop continues

## 10. Security And Privacy Considerations

Current architecture notes:
- production socket uses secure wss transport
- CORS currently permissive in backend (`allow_origins=["*"]`)
- emergency data includes sensitive contact and location context

Hardening recommendations:
1. restrict CORS to known origins for production
2. add auth/token verification for websocket sessions
3. move host and feature toggles to environment-based config
4. define retention policy for logs and prediction metadata
5. implement rate limits and payload size checks on websocket input

## 11. Performance Tuning Playbook

Client tuning levers:
- frame interval constants
- camera resolution preset
- connection retry strategy
- UI update throttling

Backend tuning levers:
- FRAME_SKIP_MS
- confidence threshold
- max detections
- CPU thread/executor tuning
- model quantization/optimization in future iterations

Monitoring recommendations:
- websocket connection count
- median inference time
- dropped-frame ratio
- prediction confidence distribution
- reconnect frequency per client

## 12. Suggested Future Architecture Improvements

1. Centralized runtime config service
- unify endpoint and feature flags in one config layer

2. Dedicated domain layers in Flutter
- separate presentation, application, and infra logic for easier testing

3. Protocol versioning
- include protocol version in websocket handshake/payload

4. Observability improvements
- structured logs, tracing IDs, and dashboard metrics

5. Scalable inference topology
- queue/broker or inference worker pool for high concurrent load

6. Model lifecycle management
- explicit model version pinning and rollout strategy

## 14. End-To-End Architecture Summary

VANI uses a pragmatic hybrid architecture:
- Flutter handles cross-platform UI and device integrations
- FastAPI + YOLO provides real-time ISL inference over websocket
- Supabase and Hive combine cloud sync with local-first emergency reliability
- localization and responsive design support broad accessibility use-cases

The most critical production path is:
camera frame -> websocket transport -> YOLO inference -> smoothed prediction -> actionable UI feedback.

This path is already implemented and operational, with room for improved configurability, security hardening, and observability as the system scales.
